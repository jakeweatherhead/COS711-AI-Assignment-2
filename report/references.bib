  ABSTRACT = {Almonds are nutrient-rich nuts. Due to their high level of consumption and relatively high price, their production is targeted for illegal practices, with the intention of earning more profit. The most common adulterants are based on superficial matching, and as an adulterant, the apricot kernel is comparatively inexpensive and almost identical in color, texture, odor, and other physicochemical characteristics to almonds. In this study, a near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (NIR-HSI) system in the wavelength range of 900–1700 nm synchronized with a conveyor belt was used for the online detection of added apricot kernels in almonds. A total of 448 samples from different varieties of almonds and apricot kernels (112 × 4) were scanned while the samples moved on the conveyor belt. The spectral data were extracted from each imaged nut and used to develop a partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) model coupled with different preprocessing techniques. The PLS-DA model displayed over a 97% accuracy for the validation set. Additionally, the beta coefficient obtained from the developed model was used for pixel-based classification. An image processing algorithm was developed for the chemical mapping of almonds and apricot kernels. Consequently, the obtained model was transferred for the online sorting of seeds. The online classification system feedback had an overall accuracy of 85% for the classification of nuts. However, the model presented a relatively low accuracy when evaluated in real-time for online application, which might be due to the rough distribution of samples on the conveyor belt, high speed, delaying time in suction, and lighting variations. Nevertheless, the developed online prototype (NIR-HSI) system combined with multivariate analysis exhibits strong potential for the classification of adulterated almonds, and the results indicate that the system can be effectively used for the high-throughput screening of adulterated almond nuts in an industrial environment.},
