    This report investigates the effectiveness of various 
    neural network configurations for optimising model
    performance on a 
    three-class almond classification problem using a 
    hybrid-learning implementation. A series of experiments were 
    conducted to fine-tune both the architecture
    and hyperparameters, exploring a range of 
    training algorithms. Notably, hybrid-learning
    significantly improved the learning process 
    on unseen test cases versus using only a single training algorithm. The impact of the Cosine 
    Annealing Warm Restarts (CAWR) learning rate scheduler was also 
    tested leading to further performance improvements. 
    An analysis is presented of 
    the conducted experiments, detailing the interactions between 
    architectures, optimization strategies and 
    hyperparameter configurations as well as the observed benefits of
    incorporating synthetic data in training.
